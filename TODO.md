## RESUME
- Implement something that displays a thumbnail of the actual PDF file instead of manually needing a .png
    - The module that handles this has a bug currently

## NAV BAR
- Unsure if this should be the final visual design or not.

## TIERLIST
- Want to be able to sort by genre, year, artist, colour (maybe)
- Make sure to cite the album artworks
- On the y-scroll, separate albums into tiers (similar to google sheets)
    - for each tier, have an x-scroll to see the album covers, which open to the respective album's review
- Have separate pages for each tier

## Colour Palette
- Make a colour palette 

## Font
- Figure out the font importing issues
